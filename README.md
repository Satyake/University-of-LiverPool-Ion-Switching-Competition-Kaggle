# University-of-LiverPool-Ion-Switching-Competition-Kaggle
This repository contains the network i have designed for the Ion-Switching prediction challenge hosted by the University of Liverpool England. The objective of the competition was to predict the number of channels that open when a potential is applied accross the cell membrane. 
I have utilized Gated Recurrent Units and 1D Convolution to perform the classficiation.
The signal is first seggregated into 1000 timesteps.
